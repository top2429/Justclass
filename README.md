# JustClass

As a final project of the course "Đồ án chuyên ngành A", this is a mobile app that facilitates the communication between teachers and students. It was heavily inspired by Google Classroom and completed by a team of two members.
I built this mobile app, and [Minh](https://github.com/pdnminh99) set up the API server.
